This repository contain the code used in my master thesis "Comparison of resampling techniques for outcome-oriented predictive business process monitoring". 
My study explores the impact of resampling techniques on the predictive performance of outcome-oriented Predictive Business Process Monitoring (PBPM). 

To use this repository to rerun my experiment:
1. Clone it to your own laptop.
2. Change the variable project_folder in global_variables.py to your own project folder.
3. Run main.py to get the metrics of each resampling techniques. The full results are stored in metrics_report folder, the visualization of the results are stored in visualization_plot folder.
4. To compare the influence of weights in each metrics, run weight_tester.py.
